Welcome to the ConstrainedPlanningToolbox repository!

The toolbox provides a collection of models, algorithms and tools that can be used for multi-agent planning under uncertainty in environments with resource constraints. 

More information about the toolbox can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/erwinwalraven/ConstrainedPlanningToolbox/wiki) of this project.
