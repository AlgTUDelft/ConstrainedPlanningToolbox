# Simple example based upon the WWW

# Scenario: You have a web site which offers a range of products and
# you want to tailor the products offered or advertised to the type of
# person that is visiting your site.  You do not want to interfere
# with their browsing, so the only clues to their personality are the
# products they seem to be interested in.

values: reward
discount: 0.95

states:

S1 # person is type 1
S2 # person is type 2
SN # person is somewhere in between the two types
SX # nobody connected

actions:

A1 # advertise type 1 products
A2 # advertise type 2 products
AN # advertise neutral products

observations:

O1 # page selected is type 1
O2 # page selected is type 2
ON # page selected is type 3
OB # person buys a product
OX # person leaves the site
