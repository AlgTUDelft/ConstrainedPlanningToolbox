You can use the guide below to build LPSolve from source on Mac OS X. The guide has been verified to work correctly, but please use at your own risk.

1. We assume that lpsolve_src is your current working directory.

2. Execute: cd lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55

3. Execute: sh ccc.osx

4. Two files have been created, which can be checked using: ls bin/osx64/liblp*. It should show bin/osx64/liblpsolve55.a and bin/osx64/liblpsolve55.dylib.

5. Copy the newly created files to the /usr/local/lib directory: sudo cp bin/osx64/liblpsolve55.a bin/osx64/liblpsolve55.dylib /usr/local/lib.

6. Now change your working directory to the java API using: cd ../../lp_solve_5.5_java

7. Go to the library directory for Mac: cd lib/mac

8. Execute: tr -d "\r" < build-osx > build-osxl

9. Open build-osxl in a text editor and modify LPSOLVE_DIR such that it points to the lpsolve_src/lp_solve_5.5 directory (use the full path).

10. Execute: sh build-osxl

11. Create the java extensions directory if necessary: mkdir -p ~/Library/Java/Extensions

12. Copy the newly created jnilib file to the extensions directory: cp liblpsolve55j.jnilib ~/Library/Java/Extensions

Done!
